L system:
F-move forward FORWARD*SCALE meters.
0,1,2,3,4-sub-branch
[,]-push/pop respectively
L-draw terminating leaf
R-rotate YROTATE degrees around the branch
T-tilt (rotate TILT degrees about the z axis of the branch)
Turtle starts at (modelx,modely,modelz), is facing upward (y), 
and it's plane is parallel with the xy axis
Axiom: 0
0 -> FF[RL1][RR2][RRR3]F[RL3][RR1][RRR2]RFLR0
1 -> FL[T[RF]2]R[TRFL]RTFL4
2 -> FL[TRF3]RFLRTFL2
3 -> FL[TFL2RFL]R[T[RFLF3]]RTFL2
4 -> FL[TRFL4]RFLRTFL4

Compilation: just type 'make'

Extra features: animation - smooth growing and randomized wind motion, 
true 3D L-system and tree.
To enable growth, press 'h'. 

Group Questions:
1) When switching to an orthographic projection, the tree appears flat, 
and branches that come toward the screen when using the perspective 
projection just lie flat against all the other branches.
2) This is because when using an orthographic projection, all sense of
depth is lost since perspective warping does not happen.

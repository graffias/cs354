1.) 
An orthographic projection maps points to a viewport using parallel projection lines.
A perspective projection projects into a single point with the screen x units away
from that point.  The projection lines of a perspective projection all intersect at
that point.  glFrustum multiplies the current matrix with a perspective matrix
while glOrtho multiplies the current matrix with an orthographic matrix.  glFrustum
and gluPerspective do essentially the same thing, however gluPerspective creates the
projection matrix with slightly more intuitive parameters.
Calling gluPerspective() with glFrustum() parameters:
	gluPerspective(2*atan(right/near)*(180/M_PI),right/top,near,far);

2.)
The same L-system can be used for the leaf, as the 'branches' in the L-system
could represent the veins on the leaf.  However drawing the leaf would be
quite different, depending on the style of leaf.  For instance, to draw a maple
leaf, we would need a planar shape around the branches, connecting all of the
branches to leaf tissue.  The perimeter of this planar shape could be calculated
by using the endpoints of the branches after the final iteration of the L-system,
or another L-system could be used to outline the leaf perimeter.

a.

A * B * P = [[-3.0622]
             [8.69615]
             [1      ]]

The point P is first translated by x=2 and y=3, then it is rotated about the Z axis
by 60 degrees.

b.

B * A * P = [[0.5359]
             [8.4641]
             [1     ]]

The point P is first rotated about the Z axis by 60 degrees, then translated by
x=2 and y=3. 

c.

Because the point has do be drawn before translating to the new position.

4.)
Assuming the axis of symmetry is the y axis:

radian_increment = 2*pi/(number of triangles)
For each pair of verticies in the cross section between y==top and y==bottom
       For radians from 0 to 2*pi, radians+=radian_increment
	   draw a quad using the top most vertex, the vertex underneath, and
	   two corresponding verticies radian_increment from these in the circle.

Then, using the top vertex as the center, draw a triangle fan using the circle of verticies
underneath the top vertex.  Finally, using the bottom vertex as the center, draw a triangle
fan using the circle of verticies just above the bottom vertex.

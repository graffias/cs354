1. a) You can just pass different values for the number of slices when
      calling glutWireCone().
   b) You could change the number of triangles used for the cone by using 
      less (or more) divisions around the center of the base for the bottom 2 
      vertices of each triangle.
2. a) First, you divide the bottom and top circular planes of the cylinder
      into an arbitrary number of divisions (>3), the more divisions, the
      smoother the cylinder.  Every 2 adjacent divisions of the cylinder
      are 2 verticies of a triangle.  The third vertex is on the opposite
      side of the cylinder.  Each triangle would be right triangles, and
      would form quadrilaterals with triangles rotated 180 degrees and 
      positioned right above.  These quadrilaterals will be situated around
      the cylinder, forming a cylindrical approximation using a triangle strip.
   b) Each pair of triangles would be situated in such a way that they form a
      quadrilateral (as above).  Then an arbitrary number of triangle strips
      around the surface of the sphere can be stacked on top of each other,
      thus eventually spanning the surface of a spherical approximation.
3.  It would be rendered very much like the way we rendered the cone
    using GL's vertex and index arrays in Display Mode 6, except instead
    of using the GL_TRIANGLES rendering mode, we use GL_LINE_LOOP as follows:
 
  glEnableClientState(GL_VERTEX_ARRAY);

  glVertexPointer(3, GL_FLOAT, 0, object_vertices);
  glDrawElements(GL_LINE_LOOP, num_indices,
		 GL_UNSIGNED_INT, object_indices);
  
  glDisableClientState(GL_VERTEX_ARRAY);

4. The only way this could be done is if you use glBegin(GL_TRIANGLES), and
   specify every triangle individually, using the same color for each vertex
   of the current triangle.  The limitation of triangle fans is that the
   color of shared vertices will blend into each triangle the vertex is used.

Performance Tests
1. Solid cube - 0.29 sec
   Wire cube  - 0.23 sec
2. Quad cube  - 0.29 sec
3. Quad array cube - 0.29 sec
4. Solid cone - 0.38 sec
   Wire cone  - 0.35 sec
5. Triangle cone - 0.30 sec
6. Triangle array cone - 0.30 sec
7. Calculated cone - 0.29 sec

The wire cube ran the quickest, though almost all of them ran at about the
same speed.  The only exception would be the glut cone, but I would guess
this was because it had more slices and stacks than the other cones, and
therefore more to render.

Note:  For the freeform scene, I decided that a static collection of
models was quite boring and decided to try to use animation.  For the
animation timing, I have used an interval timer set by setitimer(), and
I update the scene after receiving a SIGALRM signal.  The scene is
updated 60 times a second.
